## Population Structure

### Dealing with *Stacks* outputs

For population structure analyses, you should really only need the following output files from Stacks (and can get by with as few as one): a .vcf (--vcf argument of populations), the plink format .ped and .map files (--plink argument of populations), or the STRUCTURE output file (--structure argument of populations). However, these files aren't ready to be plugged into an analysis and you'll need to do some editing/converting to get them ready.
